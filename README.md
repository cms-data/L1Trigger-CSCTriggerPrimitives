# L1Trigger-CSCTriggerPrimitives

This repository holds 10 look-up-tables which, in their current form, map a 12-bit comparator code onto a floating point number. That can either be a position offset or a slope. In the current form, there are 5 patterns (0 through 4) and 4096 comparator codes. In future versions, the values in the look-up-tables will be translated from floating point to unsigned int.
